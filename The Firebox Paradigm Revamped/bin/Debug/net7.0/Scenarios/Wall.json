            "\"The new leader, Gabriel Vargas, has taken over the project and in his few weeks as president, has already made many drastic departures from the standards laid out by Aleksander in 40 years before him.\"",
            "\"In controlling the Phoenix continent, Vargas has secured his place as the most powerful man in the world, and he pledges safety and security, although his criminal record would seem to protest anything but.",
            "\"A US native, Vargas has been accused on many occasions of tax fraud and various types of assault and blackmail to stop his dark secrets from getting out, having even been found in documents which seem to connect him to underground drug rings and corporate espionage circles.",
            "\"Many campaigns have been made to place him into a prison cell, but unfortunately the wheels of international justice cannot turn by rumours alone, and as it just so happens, that's all there is.",
            "\"As a result, many people worldwide have become fed up with his games and are now travelling to the city with the intent of revolution. Secret fight clubs lurk in underground arenas organised by ex-military soldiers, with intent to train up bands of revolutionaries, and the recent announcement of martial law has only seemed to fuel the fire, bringing more and more unsatisfied victims of his schemes to the city.",
            "\"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to enter the city as a worker, infiltrate the wall hierarchy and collect any information you can find to link this man to a concrete sign of criminal activity. We must do everything we can to prevent civil conflict, and if that means beating him at his own game, then that is what we will do.",
